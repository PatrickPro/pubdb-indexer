# PubDB Indexer

This is  our LMU Media-Informatics PublicationDB-Indexer.
We used this script to index the existing file-based database to migrate it to mongo.
This software was developed during the Media-Informatics course 'information visualization' winter semester 2014/2015.

## Notice
Original database files not provided.
See example database layout in /pubdb.

## Usage
Setup mongo, modify paths accordingly. 
Run the script.
Use our [pubdb-api](https://github.com/PatrickPro/pubdb-api) and [pubdb-d3](https://github.com/PatrickPro/pubdb-d3)
